# ChessUnwinnableAnalyzer

This project contains code for categorizing unwinnible chess positions, i.e. positions where there is no series of legal moves that would result in one side achieving checkmate. This is not intended to be able to categorize every possible unwinnable position, and may be inaccurate or incomplete for certain types of positions.

The project is inspired by and makes use of output created by the [Chess Unwinnability Analyzer](https://chasolver.org/). However, there is no affiliation between the two projects.
